# Super simple calendar appointment app (Day Planner)

  A simple app that helps user to add plan according to time without conflicting with other appointments. Set up routines for week and month. Can update and delete the appointments too.
  Both UI and API is done for the app, UI built with React JS and API built with ASP.NET core.
  
  This project is super helpful if you are a beginner, willing to learn webAPIs, C# and REST Standard,then start with this app. So you could come to gain an understanding of CRUD Application, WebAPIs, how to interlink frontend and api, how to make an api request from client side. Simple but helpful without over exposing and no frustration.
